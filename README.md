# What is this?
This is mainly useful if you have a website that accepts payments/donations in exchange for perks inside your Minecraft server.

The plugin acts as a bridge between your website backend and your Minecraft server.

# What can it do?
From your website backend, you can:
- Add or remove PEX ranks
- Add or remove Discord guild roles
- Add money to player balances (no remove yet)

# How does it work?
It will periodically poll the configured database for new records of ranks, discord roles, and economy balance updates.
